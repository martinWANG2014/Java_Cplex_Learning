## IDE to suggest:
1. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/download/), free for student and acamdemic purpose usage of ultimate version, free for all of community version.   
2. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

## Lecture
The lecture is one part of the book called "Core Java Volume I: Fundamentals (10th Edition, chinese version)" and "Core Java Volume II: Advanced features (10th Edition, chinese version)"  written by Cay S.Horstmann.
### Part I : [Chapter 3 of volume I, basic concept for java](https://github.com/martinWANG2014/Java_Cplex_Learning/blob/main/TP1/Learning_Java_I_1.pdf) and [Chapter 2 of volume II, input and output](https://github.com/martinWANG2014/Java_Cplex_Learning/blob/main/TP1/Learning_Java_I_2.1.pdf).
We suggest that the reader should well master the IO stream of files which is essential for solving OR optimization problem. Hereby, the reader know well how to parse an instance file and write out a solution of a corresponding OR optimization problem in a file with sepecified format. 
#### [TP1: manipulation of file](https://github.com/martinWANG2014/Java_Cplex_Learning/blob/main/TP1/TP1.pdf)
1. Read an [instance](https://github.com/martinWANG2014/Java_Cplex_Learning/blob/main/TP1/instance.txt) and transformer into a new file with specified format. An example of solution is given in [output file](https://github.com/martinWANG2014/Java_Cplex_Learning/blob/main/TP1/output.txt).
2. Given some generation rules, appending new generated data into the orginal instance file.
